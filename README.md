## Preamble

**The Ninth Path** is a lore-heavy, spiritually charged Skyrim SE/AE modlist built around high-stakes choices, fate-bending consequences, and the silent war between divinity and mortality. Inspired by philosophical and esoteric themes, this list invites you to walk a path few have dared — beyond gods, beyond Daedra, beyond time.

If you enjoy:
- Mystical exploration and forgotten truths
- Moral ambiguity and personal consequence
- Prophecy, fate, and the illusion of choice
- Ancient ruins, lost worlds, and impossible timelines

Then *The Ninth Path* was made for you.
