1200+ mods can change the game quite a bit. I will try to go over everything of importance, pointing out key gameplay mods, quests, followers, homes, and tips. Some things I have purposely left out, for you to explore.

In addition to the [Creation Club houses](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Houses#Creation_Club_HousesCC), I've added a few custom player homes.

- [Castle Volkihar Rebuilt](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/324) allows you to turn the North Tower of Castle Volkihar into a player home once the Dawnguard DLC is completed. You can also clean up the castle, and if you side with the Dawnguard, they will move in.
- [Dovahkiin's Vault](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42237) A small vault in the Throat of the World for storing away all those sketchy arcane objects in a safe location away from innocent people and your family. Only accessible with Clear Skies shout. You can find the key on a skeleton near Paarthurnax's perch.
- [Mörskom Estate](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33408) is a large player home situated on the hillside of Dawnstar. The mod comes with a short quest to acquire the home before the player will need to restore the building to its former glory, including the exterior and interior. Depending on your play style, Mörskom can be rebuilt using skill and materials or paid workers.
- [Magelight Keep](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83670) is a spouse and adoption-friendly property in Falkreath Hold. Magelight Keep offers plenty of living space with two towers, a courtyard, and resident blacksmith and housekeeper. You can purchase the house by interacting with the sign near the study tower door.
- [Riverside Lodge](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9567) is a picturesque and fully equipped player home between Whiterun and Riverwood. You can purchase the house by interacting with the sign near the front door.
- [The Tiniest Shack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46874) adds a tiny shack in Riverwood, across the river from the town. You can purchase the shack by interacting with the sign near the front door.
